# GradCoin
Educational Rewarding Token based on CGPA

A cutting-edge initiative called Gradcoin seeks to completely transform how academic rewards are given to students. Professors can reward students based on their academic achievement on this safe and secure platform. Professors can use the platform to monitor their students' academic progress and give them "gradcoins" based on their CGPA. Gradcoins are virtual currency that students can collect and trade for benefits like scholarships, book purchases, and other academic advantages.By enabling both students and teachers to view the highest GPA, top performer, and average GPA, Gradcoin promotes transparency and accountability. The ease with which students can monitor their development and the number of Gradcoins they have accrued over time gives them a feeling of accomplishment and motivation to strive for academic excellence.

## Description:
The main users of GradCoin are Professors and Students. Professors can use the 
HTML User interface to transfer tokens to students. They simply need to enter the 
student's Ethereum address, name, and CGPA, and click on the transfer button. This 
information is then sent to the app.js file, which executes the necessary actions by 
calling functions in the "GradCoin.sol" smart contract. The results of these actions 
are displayed on the HTML page, and the tokens are transferred to the student's 
account.
There are several other functions available, including Highest CGPA, AverageCGPA, 
and ShowTopPerformer, which can be accessed by both students and professors. 
However, only professors can transfer GradCoin tokens.
In addition, there is a function called "ShowStudentBalance" that is exclusively for 
students. This function allows them to view the balance of their accounts
